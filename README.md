An NFC app that can read and display data from an NFC, and pass data to an NFC. All written in Swift.

# Why?

Hello all,
I programmed this app for a simple reason. I have a portafilter coffee maker. Since I do not always want to use the same beans for my coffee, I put them in small containers. Anyone who knows about coffee and coffee grinders knows that all coffee beans have a different grind, and various other properties to consider when grinding. These properties are usually written on the packaging of the beans. But since I have filled the beans in different containers is now no longer on the containers. So I thought that the smartest thing to do would be to attach an NFC tag to the different containers, which when I scan with my phone, gives me all the information about the beans I want to use. Plus, I've never worked with NFCs before, so I thought it would be a great challenge.
